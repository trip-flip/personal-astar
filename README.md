Implementation of the A* Algorithm, written in Go

Was my first attempt at using the Go language (syntax, module management, etc.). Go is quite like C, it's neat.

Still needs work done, such as obstacles, maybe some optimizations, testing perhaps. But it can take a
distinct start and distinct goal and find a path between them in a square grid.
